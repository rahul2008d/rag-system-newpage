This is the same classic RAG use-case you might be familiar with.   Option 2: Code Documentation Assistant Build a system that ingests a codebase (GitHub repo or local files) and answers questions about the code. For example: how it works, where functionality is implemented, API endpoints, dependencies, etc.   Option 3: Meeting Intelligence System Build a system that analyzes meeting transcripts and answers questions about discussions, decisions, and action items. Transcripts should be text files with speaker labels and timestamps. Optional bonus: Add voice-to-transcript capability. "}

Option 4: Career Intelligence Assistant Build a system that analyzes resumes against job descriptions. Upload a resume and multiple job postings, then answer questions about fit, skill gaps, experience alignment, and interview preparation. Example queries: \"What skills am I missing for this role?\", \"How does my experience align with Job #2?\"   Choose the option that excites you most!  We care as much about how you build it as what you build. This is your chance to show us your engineering philosophy in action.
